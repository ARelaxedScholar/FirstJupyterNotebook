But it failed, and got so convoluted that I figured I might as well clean up everything and start from scratch. So here goes.\n\nThe process to create a deep-learning model for images seems to be roughly the following\n1. Find images to train the model on (obviously this will vary based on the problem)\n2. Validate the images and label them somehow. (One way is to simply arrange them in folders)\n3. If you got a lot of money and data, train your own model from scratch with super powerful computers **OR** If you're everyone else, use a pretrained model and fine-tune it for your purposes.\n4. Test the model\n5. If it works, enjoy as this model can be used like pretty much any other standard function. If not starts debugging time. And maybe reconsider if AI is the best solution for your issue.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Step 1 : Find images\nSince I am really building this as a mean to test the technology, I will simply nerd out.
